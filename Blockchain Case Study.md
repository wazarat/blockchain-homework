# Case Study: CryptoKitties

## What Is It

CryptoKitties is a blockchain-based game that is based on the Ethereum Blockchain. It is built by the Vancouver-based design studio AxiomZen. 
To be honest, the entire concept of CryptoKitties is as easy as pie. That is first of all, a game. The whole structure of which is focused on breeding cats and getting the most rare breeds of them, which are only possible. In other words, you use a digital virtual kitten and make more kittens, while meeting other cats.

One may ask, what is the point of getting rare breeds of the kittens. Users are able to make money on them, while selling the virtual kids of the pet. Kittens can be sold for several thousand dollars. Being run on ether, allows people from all over to buy and sell these kittens. The game started with only 100 kitties and people have been able to have more kitties by breeding them. One may say that it is a similar concept to a cryptocurrency where kitties are being bred like cryptocurrency is being mined. 

## Why This Matters

There have been similar games like Pokemon Go where the player is able to obtain a character and play the game. However, in CryptoKitties, the users purchase kitties using Ether. You can groom new kitties and sell them as well. Hence, this game can be used as an investment tool where one can make a profit by creating more value in the game. The significance of CryptoKitties can be shown by the fact that the company was founded on November 28th, 2017 and an article on TechCrunch published on December 3rd,2017 states that over $1Million had been spent on buying virtual cats using this platform. 

Cryptokitties has been a pioneer with incorportating blockchain technology in the gaming industry. Whereas most pay to play platforms only have their users pay to get different features, Cryptokitties is allowing the users to actually the treat the game as an investment. 

## Why This May be Interesting

CryptoKitties can potentially change the landscape of how (and why) games are played. While many have been gaming just for fun. Games like CryptoKitties have incorporated a financial component to these games where users can play these games to actually make more money. Gaming which was traditionally considered as a hobby or a time-waste can now be considered as an investment. Cryptokitties have been able to use the concept of bitcoin and ethereum where these cryptocurrencies are limited in supply and they have been able to apply is to the gaming industry. 
This is a new concept which is only 3 years old. It will be interesting to see how it not only impacts the gaming and blockchain industries, but also how it impacts the future of investments.
