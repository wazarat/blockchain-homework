# Case Study: CryptoKitties

## What Is It

CryptoKitties is a blockchain-based game that is based on the Ethereum Blockchain. It is built by the Vancouver-based design studio AxiomZen. 
To be honest, the entire concept of CryptoKitties is as easy as pie. That is first of all, a game. The whole structure of which is focused on breeding cats and getting the most rare breeds of them, which are only possible. In other words, you use a digital virtual kitten and make more kittens, while meeting other cats.

You may ask, what is the point of getting rare breeds of the kittens. The answer is simple. You are able to make money on them, while selling the virtual kids of your pet. And, I am not joking, several days ago, one of the kittens was sold for $37.000. Sounds unbelievable. However, the system of CryptoKitties is a sort of a mode of the international market, where you can make money from absolutely nothing. Well, let us get a bit dipper inside the system and figure out, how to start making money.

## Why This Matters

There have been similar games like Pokemon Go where the player is able to obtain a character and play the game. However, in CryptoKitties, the users purchase kitties using Ether. You can groom new kitties and sell them as well. Hence, this game can be used as an investment tool where one can make a profit by creating more value in the game. The significance of CryptoKitties can be shown by the fact that the company was founded on November 28th, 2017 and an article on TechCrunch published on December 3rd,2017 states that over $1Million had been spent on buying virtual cats using this platform. 

Cryptokitties has been a pioneer with incorportating blockchain technology in the gaming industry. Whereas most pay to play platforms only have their users pay to get different features, Cryptokitties is allowing the users to actually the treat the game as an investment.
